HorseTracker - Kotlin Android App

Horse Racing Tracker
=================

A horse tracker app illustrating Android development best practices with Android studio.


Horse racing Tracker was under heavy development the last couple of weeks from doing the
weekly labs to doing my own project. I had many crashes and interruption but to hard work i fixed a lot of these.
if the app crashes please uninstall it and reinstall it to create new lists and you'll be ready to add horses.

Introduction
------------

Android studio is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps and this is what I am using to build my tracker. You 
can do so much in android studio and I will be developing my app in this. This does a great job on it so far and I hope to keep using it in the future.


The horse Tracker will track each of the horses you create and you can read, update, delete are only some examples of what you will be able to do.  
You will have many nice pages that you will be brought to. first of all you will have a nice splash screen with a  nice horse logo and this will be an 
animated look icon zooming small to big and you will be displayed with a welcome message. this page will only be seen within one second.
The next page you will be brought to where the horse information will be added and shown here. the information that will be shown here is 
horse name, horse breeder, owner, trainer, sex which could be make or female. you will be able to see an image also of the horse. 

Press the plus button to add a horse and the required information such as mentioned above, you will also be able to add a picture of horse , 
location of the horse or trainer or breeder, up to you. to add the horse just press the plus button and it will then bring back to the list and you will now see the list of the information you inputted. if you don't input any information it will not let you continue and will bring you back to the list area until you add a full 
information about the horse, you can change the picture, uppadte details and change location. you can also delete the horse list and it will be erased. the persistence is working 
and the list will be saved when you come back in.
the spinner I created for the sex of the horse was a nice cool feature for ease of access. i made the UI look nice with  three theme colors through the project as its easy on the eye. 
its easy to navigate and see the lists and the information. The fonts are perfect and created for ease on the eye and to navigate. the CRUD is fully working. the app worked out successfully and I hope to build many more.

Experience 
---------------
I had great experience doing this as i learned a lot as I went along. I added a lot of nice add ons to make it easy to access.

Research
-----------
For the extra bits i added in, i did research from the labs and knowledge i learned off other people and from previous projects i worked on in WIT. 
I also did an very good KOTLIN course during the covid so this also helped a small but through my project.
